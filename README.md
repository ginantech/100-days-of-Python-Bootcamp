# Python Pizza Delivery Program

This is a beginner-level Python project from the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" course. 
The program simulates a simple pizza ordering system where users can choose size and toppings. 
Based on the inputs, the program calculates and displays the final bill.

## Features

- Choose pizza size: Small (S), Medium (M), or Large (L)
- Option to add:
  - Pepperoni (extra cost based on size)
  - Extra cheese (flat cost)
- Bill calculation based on user choices
- Simple input validation

## Example

Welcome to Python Pizza Deliveries!
What size pizza do you want? S, M or L: M
Do you want pepperoni on your pizza? Y or N: Y
Do you want extra cheese? Y or N: Y
Your final bill is: $24.


## How It Works

- Small Pizza: $15  
- Medium Pizza: $20  
- Large Pizza: $25  

**Add-ons:**
- Pepperoni: +$2 for Small, +$3 for Medium/Large
- Extra Cheese: +$1 for any size

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the `.py` file.
2. Run the script in any Python 3 environment:
